# NanoProxy

NanoProxy is a bridge layer for NanoGPT when native tool calling is unreliable.

It sits between the client and NanoGPT, replaces fragile native tool-calling with a stricter bridge protocol, and converts the result back into normal OpenAI-style `tool_calls` for the client. That lets tools like OpenCode keep working normally even when NanoGPT would otherwise stop early, leak raw tool text, or return malformed tool output.

## Which mode should I use?

### Use the plugin if you use OpenCode
This is the easiest setup for OpenCode.

- No local proxy server to keep running
- No custom provider setup
- Keep using the normal built-in NanoGPT provider

### Use the standalone server for other tools
Use this if:

- you are not using OpenCode
- your client supports an OpenAI-compatible base URL
- you prefer a separate local proxy process

## OpenCode Plugin Setup

The plugin intercepts NanoGPT API requests inside OpenCode and applies the NanoProxy bridge automatically.

Example config:

```json
{
  "plugin": [
    "file:///path/to/NanoProxy/src/plugin.mjs"
  ]
}
```

Notes:
- Use a real absolute file path.
- On Windows, a valid example looks like:
  - `file:///C:/Users/you/path/to/NanoProxy/src/plugin.mjs`
- After editing the config, restart OpenCode.

### Plugin debug logging

Enable debug logging for one OpenCode run:

```sh
NANOPROXY_DEBUG=1 opencode
```

Optional:
- set `NANOPROXY_LOG=/path/to/file` to change the single event log file location
- set `NANOPROXY_LOG_DIR=/path/to/folder` to change where detailed per-request debug files are written

On Windows, you can also use the same persistent toggle used by the standalone server:

```sh
./toggle-debug.ps1
```

That writes a `.debug-logging` flag file in the repo. When that flag is present, both:
- the OpenCode plugin
- the standalone server

will enable NanoProxy debug logging until you toggle it off again.

When debug mode is enabled, NanoProxy also writes:
- a single event log file
- per-request `*-request.json`
- raw streamed `*-stream.sse`
- parsed `*-response.json`

By default these go into:
- event log: your system temp folder as `nanoproxy-plugin.log`
- detailed logs: your system temp folder under `nanoproxy-plugin-logs`

## Standalone Server Setup

Run the server:

```sh
node server.js
```

Then point your coding tool to:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

Keep using your normal NanoGPT API key in that tool.

If your tool supports a custom OpenAI-compatible provider or `baseURL`, use `http://127.0.0.1:8787` there.

Optional overrides:

```sh
UPSTREAM_BASE_URL=https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1
PROXY_HOST=127.0.0.1
PROXY_PORT=8787
node server.js
```

### Server debug logging

Off by default.

Enable for one run:

```sh
NANO_PROXY_DEBUG=1 node server.js
```

Or toggle persistently on Windows:

```sh
./toggle-debug.ps1
```

That same toggle also enables plugin debug logging.

Server logs are written to `Logs/`.

### Health check

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/health
```

## Docker

If you want to run the standalone server in Docker instead of running Node directly:

```sh
docker build -t nano-proxy .
docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 nano-proxy
```

Or with Compose:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

This still exposes the proxy at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

## What NanoProxy actually does

For tool-enabled requests:

1. It removes the normal native tool-calling structure before sending the request upstream.
2. It tells the model to use a stricter text-based tool format instead.
3. It watches the model output.
4. It converts that output back into normal OpenAI-style `tool_calls`.

So your client still sees normal tool calls, but NanoGPT does not have to rely on its native tool-calling behavior.

## Bridge format

Tool reply:

```text
[[OPENCODE_TOOL]]
[[CALL]]
{"name": "read", "arguments": {"filePath": "src/app.js"}}
[[/CALL]]
[[/OPENCODE_TOOL]]
```

Multiple independent tool calls in one turn:

```text
[[OPENCODE_TOOL]]
[[CALL]]
{"name": "read", "arguments": {"filePath": "src/app.js"}}
[[/CALL]]
[[CALL]]
{"name": "read", "arguments": {"filePath": "src/styles.css"}}
[[/CALL]]
[[/OPENCODE_TOOL]]
```

Final answer:

```text
[[OPENCODE_FINAL]]
Your answer here.
[[/OPENCODE_FINAL]]
```

## Notes

- Requests without tools are forwarded unchanged.
- Reasoning streams live.
- Tool and final content are buffered until NanoProxy can classify them safely.
- Up to 5 parallel tool calls per turn are supported for models that behave well with batching.
- Some models may still behave better with one tool call per turn.

## Troubleshooting

### OpenCode says the config file is invalid JSON
- Make sure the config file is valid JSON or JSONC.
- On Windows, avoid saving it with weird encoding or a BOM if OpenCode rejects it.

### Plugin seems to do nothing
- Check that the plugin path is correct.
- Make sure it is a `file:///...` URL, not a normal path string.
- Restart OpenCode after editing the config.
- If needed, enable `NANOPROXY_DEBUG=1` and check the plugin log output.

### Tool text leaks into the chat
- This usually means the model drifted into a malformed tool format.
- Try again once first.
- If it keeps happening, enable debug logs and inspect what the model actually emitted.

### Standalone server does not respond
- Make sure `node server.js` is still running.
- Check `http://127.0.0.1:8787/health`.
